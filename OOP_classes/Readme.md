### Program Name: Object-Oriented Programming

#### Description:
*  This code demonstrates the usage of classes and inheritance in JavaScript.

#### The purpose:
* This code structure allows for a clear organization of vehicle-related data and behavior, with the Car
  class adding specific properties related to cars on top of the general vehicle characteristics inherited from the Vehicle class.

#### Technologies used:
* JavaScript: The code utilizes JavaScript to define classes, constructors, methods, and object instances.
* Classes and Inheritance: It demonstrates how to use classes and inheritance in JavaScript, allowing one
  class (Car) to inherit properties and methods from another class (Vehicle).

#### Usage:
* Object-Oriented Modeling:
  Real-world Entities: Modeling entities like vehicles, where you have a general class (like Vehicle)
  and specific types (like Car, Truck, Motorcycle) that inherit common properties but have their unique attributes.
* Code Reusability:
  Common Functionality: When multiple classes share common functionalities or properties, inheritance
  allows you to define these in a parent class, reducing redundancy and promoting reusability.
* Specialized Behavior:
  Extensions with Custom Functionality: Subclasses can add or modify methods to suit their specific requirements,
  ensuring a more specific and tailored behavior. For instance, a Car subclass might have additional methods
  like calculateMileage() or displayFuelLevel().
* Framework and Library Development:
  Framework Core with Extensions: In frameworks or libraries, core functionalities can be extended or specialized
  by developers using inheritance. For example, extending base UI components to create custom components with added features.
* Software Design Patterns:
  Strategy, Factory, and Singleton Patterns: Inheritance is integral to many design patterns where class
  relationships and hierarchies are fundamental to their implementation.

#### Practical Application:
* In a practical setting, similar concepts can be employed to model a range of entities in software development,
  allowing for clearer organization, code structure, and scalability in larger applications.
  It helps in creating a more maintainable and extensible codebase by leveraging the principles of object-oriented programming.
