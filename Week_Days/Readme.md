### Program Name: Days of the week

#### Description:
* This program prints days of the week based on the number passed in.

#### The purpose:
* Object Creation: The code initializes an object named days containing key-value pairs that map
  numeric values (1 to 7) to their corresponding day names.
* Function Declaration: It defines a function returnDay(num) that takes a number (num) as an argument
  and aims to return the day name associated with that number.
* Error Handling: The function includes error handling to ensure the input number is within the valid
  range (1 to 7). If the number is outside this range, the function returns null.
* Returning Day Name: If the input number is within the valid range, the function returns the corresponding
  day name by accessing the value associated with the key (num) in the days object.

#### Technologies used:
* JavaScript: The code is written in JavaScript, a scripting language used for web development.
* Object: It uses JavaScript's object notation to create the days object, representing a mapping
  of days to their numeric values.
* Functions: JavaScript functions are employed to encapsulate logic, enabling reuse and modularity.
* Conditional Statements: It utilizes if-else statements for condition checking and error handling.
