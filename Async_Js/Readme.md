### Program Name: Fetching data from external API

#### Description:
*  This code is an example of an asynchronous JavaScript function that fetches data from an external API.

#### The purpose:
* The purpose of this code is to fetch data asynchronously from the specified API
  endpoint and handle the retrieved data or any errors that might occur during the fetching process.

#### Technologies used:
* The entire code is written in JavaScript.
* Uses the async and await keywords to work with asynchronous operations in a more synchronous-like manner,
  making the code easier to read and understand.
* Utilizes the Fetch API, which is a modern JavaScript API used for making HTTP requests
 (such as GET, POST, etc.) to fetch resources (data) from a network.

#### Usage:
To use this code in your own JavaScript project or environment:

* Embed in a Script:
  Place this code within a script tag in an HTML file or include it in a JavaScript file.
* Execute the Function:
  Ensure that this code is executed when needed (e.g., upon page load, button click, etc.).
  Call get() to start the process of fetching data from the specified API endpoint.
* Handling Retrieved Data:
  Modify the code within console.log(data) to process the retrieved data according to your
  application's needs. You can display it in the UI, manipulate it, or use it for various functionalities.
* Error Handling:
  Customize error handling within the catch block to handle different types of errors gracefully,
  such as displaying user-friendly error messages or taking alternative actions.
* Remember to replace the API endpoint (https://catfact.ninja/breeds) with the appropriate endpoint URL from which you want to fetch data in your application.
