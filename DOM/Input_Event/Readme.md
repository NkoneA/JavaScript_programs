### Program Name: Input Event

#### Description:
*  The code establishes an event listener on the username input field to monitor changes in its value.

#### The purpose:
* Real-time feedback: When the user types into the #username input field, the content within the h1 tag
  updates dynamically to greet the user with a personalized message: "Welcome, [username]".
* Empty field handling: If the user clears the #username input field (i.e., it becomes empty),
  the h1 content changes to prompt the user: "Enter Your Username".

#### Technologies used:
* JavaScript: For DOM manipulation and event handling
* HTML: provides the necessary structure and identifiers (IDs) for JavaScript to select and interact
with specific elements on the webpage. It defines the form inputs and the list where new items are appended.

#### Usage:
* This script is typically used to enhance user experience by providing immediate feedback while filling out
a form or interacting with an input field, guiding the user on what information to input or confirming their input in real-time.
